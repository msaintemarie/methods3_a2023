```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidymodels)

d_sim <- sim_classification(
  num_samples = 100,
  method = "caret",
  intercept = 0,
  num_linear = 10
)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
